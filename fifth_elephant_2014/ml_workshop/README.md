# Real World Machine Learning Workshop

This directory will contain codes, presentation slides and other required files for 
'Real World Machine Learning' workshop at Fifth Elephant 2014, the conference and 
workshops on big data & analytics.

## Workshop slides

The workshop slides (work in progress, check file presentation.md) are created using 
[landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide) which generates beautiful HTML5 slides 
from markdown. Thanks to [Adam Zapletal](https://github.com/adamzap) and other contributors!

## Installation Pre-requisites

However, the workshop participants need to install required packages from
the Python scientific stack (Python, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas) beforehand 
in order to participate in the workshop. The installations are mandatory and 
participants would not be able to gain much without them!
