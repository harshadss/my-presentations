# About Me...

Harshad

* Senior Data Scientist @ SOKRATI

* Spent last 4 years trying to understand machine learning

# Workshop Agenda

Machine learning is *not only* about mathematical algorithms or tools or 
vizualizations or business knowledge.


>You cannot play a symphony alone, it takes an orchestra

It involves balance of,

   1. Science
   2. Process
   3. Engineering
   4. Art

# Presenter Notes

ML : popular, identified with extremely diverse set of ideas
Sometimes we miss the forest for the trees
Books and courses focus on science.
Tool and library developers focus on engineering
A real world ML problem : needs knowledge of each aspect
Workshop and conference themed around the 4 aspects
Workshop later on science (R) and engineering (solr, aerospike)
My talk on some aspects of engineering at conference, many other talks
Closing talk on art

# Workshop Agenda

## Focus on process of machine learning

* Taking a real world challenging problem
* Use science, tools and some intuition
* Create a usable solution for the problem


# Presenter Notes

Process sounds a very bureaucratic word
But what we are going to learn is vey reach
mixture of curiosity and common sense
driven from past experiences of community
Focus on process of machine learning or 'real world data science'

# What process ?

## A real world problem

> We want to sell a product to customers through telemarketing. The last time we did 
a carpet bombing exercise. Here are bunch of data point from the effort. Tell
us what should do next time. Can you automate that insight generation ?

## Flurry of questions...

* Where to start ?
* What am I supposed to model ?
* What algorithm is better suited for this ?
* Do we have too much data ? How do I know that ?
* Do we have too little data ? How do I know that ?

# Presenter Notes

* A typical question we are likely to encounter
* Always raises these flurry of questions
* Process : systematic way of answering questions
* Not focussed on getting the data in right shape : at conference
* Bottom line : useful and practical

# Typical Process

* Define objective
* Get data 
* Explore
* Model
* Evaluate
* Iterate
* Validate
